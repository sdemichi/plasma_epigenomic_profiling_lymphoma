# plasma_epigenomic_profiling_lymphoma
This is the project directory for ongoing analyses in the lymphoma plasma cohort, including collaborative analyses with other groups at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Some of the data generated as a part of the cohort includes heterochromatin profiling from plasma of lymphoma patients, mutations from paired samples, shallow whole genome sequencing, and metabolic tumor volume from PET-CT imaging. The goal of the project is to identify signatures of lymphoma from blood, along with discovery of other novel, multimodal, prognostic biomarkers.
