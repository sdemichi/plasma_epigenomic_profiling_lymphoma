# plasma_epigenomic_profiling_lymphoma
This is the project directory for ongoing analyses in the lymphoma plasma cohort, including collaborative analyses with other groups at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Some of the data generated as a part of the cohort include heterochromatin profiling from plasma of lymphoma patients, mutations from paired samples, and shallow whole genome sequencing. Goal of the project is to identify signatures of lymphoma from blood, along with discovery of other prognostic biomarkers.
